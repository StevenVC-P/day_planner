# day_planner
Single day planner, saves comments between page reloads and tracks current time of day.

This is a day planner that allows the user to save comments for each hour throughout the day.  The day at the top will change with the day, and the hours are color coded to track the hour of the day.

The user will need to click save for each textbox the leave comments in.  Any comments not saved will disappear upon refreshing the save.
